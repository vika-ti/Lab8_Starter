How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradation refers to the idea of building applications and computer systems with the ability to maintain basic functionality when certain components fail. Service workers are browser features that can cache assets such as images, scripts, and data, allowing web applications to function even when the internet connection is lost or slow. As a result, service workers support graceful degradation by helping applications maintain their functionality during network failures. This makes the application more resilient and less dependent on a resource that we do not control.
